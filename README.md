# Landing Page Project

This Landing Page takes an otherwise static HTML web page and adds interactivity to it using JavaScript and CSS classes. The most notable interactive element is the viewport itself, which highlights different sections of the page depending on where the user has scrolled. The project also features an interactive navigation bar that scrolls the page to the section that is clicked on by the user.

This landing page is the perfect example of how JavaScript can dynamically change the way an HTML document behaves and reacts to user interaction.
