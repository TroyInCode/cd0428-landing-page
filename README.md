# Project Title
**Dynamic Landing Page**

# Description
The landing page project uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive, dynamic webpage. This webpage demonstrates what can be done using JavaScript DOM manipulation. JavaScript is used to add event listeners to the navigation bar and the webpage itself. JavaScript is used to highlight specific sections of the page, depending on which section is visible in the viewport.


# Example

This landing page makes frequent use of function expressions, which typically make heavy use of the **for loop** or the **forEach()** methods, like so: 
```js
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const exampleFunction = (array) => {
    array.forEach((item) => {
        console.log(item);
    });

exampleFunction(array);
```

# Usage
As it stands, this landing page is meant to demonstrate what can be done with JavaScript DOM manipulation language. Therefore, it is not itended to be used for other projects.
